# The Sims 2
- The Sims 2 is the game of most kids and it is surprisingly running on Linux better than The Sims 3 (The Sims 3 can't even run properly on Windows either, it's a weird game).
- On my previous low end laptop and the laptop I'm currently using, I didn't experience any performance differences and I can say that the game runs with native performance on Linux.
- The Sims 2 is now an **abandonware** which means installing The Sims 2 **for free is not pirating** at all.
- The recommended way is [following this guide](https://github.com/voicemxil/TS2-Starter-Pack/wiki/Linux-Specifc-Setup-Steps), they also made a Lutris script for this web installer.
  - You can reach the Lutris script for searching **The Sims 2 - osab's TS2 Starter Pack** which is the easiest way. After the game is installed, it should launch **Graphics Rules Maker**, you should follow [these steps for it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UT0HX3cO4xLft2KozGypU_N7ZcGQVr-54QD9asFsx5U/edit#heading=h.6jnaz4t6d3vx).
- However, if you have a setup file or a DVD, I'm going to show you the manual steps.
- Let's begin then!
