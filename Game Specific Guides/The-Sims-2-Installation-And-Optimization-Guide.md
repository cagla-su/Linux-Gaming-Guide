So, you should either have the **setup file** or **the DVD** to install the game.
- If you are ready, let's begin!
## Get Started
- First of all, **extract the files** from your DVD into a folder and **open <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e14870a-70af-4e70-833b-6703dd9e9701" /> Lutris**.
- `(+)` **-** `Install a Windows game from an executable` **-** `Game name: The Sims 2` **-** `Continue until the "Select the setup file" step` **-** `Select the setup file` **-** `Complete the installation`
- After **the installation has completed**, make sure the game is **located correctly**. To do so:
  - `Right click The Sims 2` **-** `Configure` **-** `Game Options` **-** `Executable`
    - The location is generally `~/Games/the-sims-2/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection/The Sims 2 Mansion and Garden Stuff/TSBin/Sims2EP9.exe`

  - `(+)` **-** `Install a Windows game from an executable` **-** `Game name: *anything you wish*` **-** `Change the installation directory as "~/Games/the-sims-2/")` **-** `Select the setup file` **-** `Complete the installation (without launching the app)`
  - Make sure the app is **located correctly**. To do so:
    - `Right click Graphics Rules Maker` **-** `Configure` **-** `Game Options` **-** `Executable`
    - The location is `~/Games/the-sims-2/drive_c/Program Files/Graphics Rules Maker/bin/GraphicsRulesMakerUi.exe`

    - It should detect your Sims folder automatically but if it cannot, try `Mansion and Garden Stuff` folder.
  - **Next -** `Auto-detect` **-** `Save Files...`
    - Do not forget to perform the same steps for `The Sims 2 Body Shop`.
- Now you are ready to play <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35809d93-5960-4e2b-bc5d-2639cb667c04" /> The Sims 2!
