# Minecraft
Minecraft is a **Linux-native** game that works using **OpenGL**.
## Get Started
First of all, I definitely suggest you use [Prism Launcher](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher) because it is **open-source** and provides more options than the original launcher.
### Install Prism Launcher
You can install Prism Launcher following [these steps according to your distribution](https://prismlauncher.org/download/linux/).
### Install Java
Prism Launcher now automatically installs Java for you.
### Install Minecraft
- When you first launch the launcher, it will ask you what language you would like to use. After that question, you are going to see a page about Java.
- Make sure to change `Maximum memory allocation`. There is a rumor that if you allocate half your RAM, you are going to get good performance. It is wrong:
  - When you play Minecraft, the game creates many temporary things in memory, like blocks, mobs, particles, or chunks. After some time, the game does not need some of these things anymore. That's why Minecraft (or more correctly, Java) cleans up memory and this is called **garbage collection**.
  - Garbage collection finds the things that are no longer used and removes them from memory. This helps the game free up space and avoid memory problems.
  - However, if you allocate too much RAM, Java will wait longer between garbage collection cycles. But each cycle will take longer to complete, that's why you are going to get bigger lag spikes.
  - For smaller lag spikes, you should allocate **less RAM** and not more. However, do not allocate too little RAM either because in that case, Java will perform garbage collection too often and this will cause big lag spikes again.
  - When Minecraft is using between `50-75%` of allocated RAM, it is the ideal value for smaller lag spikes. You can check RAM usage during playing by pressing `F3`.
  - For my case with performance mods, allocating `3456 MiB` is the ideal value to keep RAM usage between `50-75%`. However, I suggest you experiment different values yourself to find your ideal value.
- After completing quick setup, add your Microsoft account to connect to your account in the launcher.
- Now we can finally install Minecraft. Click `Add Instance` button on the top left and continue:
  - In `Version` section, select the version you would like to play and scroll down a bit. You should see a big "**No mod loader is selected.**" warning. There is a `Mod loader` section next to the warning. Select `Fabric` from there and click `OK`.
## Optimization
- Click `Settings`, go to `Minecraft` section and click `Tweaks`. Enable `Enable Feral GameMode` (you need to install gamemode package first) and `Use discrete GPU` (only if you have two GPUs).
- Next, from `Settings` menu, go to `Environment Variables` and click `Add`.
  - Type `mesa_glthread` in **Name** and `true` in **Value** sections.
    - If you are using NVIDIA, you should type `__GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS` in **Name** and `1` in **Value** sections instead.
- Generally these steps are enough to play a better Minecraft. However, we can still increase performance with mods.
## Sodium Method - Recommended For Version 1.16.3 And Later
- First, right click your Minecraft instance and click `Edit`.
- In the opened page, click `Mods` from the left side bar and click `Download mods` from the right side bar.
- **Suggested Performance Mods and Dependencies**
  - `Cloth Config`
  - `Concurrent Chunk Management Engine`
  - `Debugify`
  - `Dynamic FPS`
  - `EntityCulling`
  - `Fabric API`
  - `Fabric Language Kotlin`
  - `FastQuit`
  - `FerriteCore`
  - `ImmediatelyFast`
  - `Lithum`
  - `ModernFix`
  - `More Culling`
  - `No Chat Reports`
  - `No Telemetry`
  - `OptiGUI`
  - `Reese's Sodium Options`
  - `Remove Reloading Screen`
  - `Sodium`
  - `Sodium Extra`
- There are lots of other performance boosting mods. However, the mods above can **significantly** increase performance while other mods do not at all. That is why installing the mods above is generally enough.
### Optifine Features Without Optifine
In Optifine, there are some cool features that are not about increasing performance such as **zooming, being able to use shaders, dynamic lighting and connected textures**. We can get the same features without Optifine through the mods below:
- **Zooming Feature -** `Zoomify`
- **Shaders Feature -** `Iris`
- **Dynamic Lighting Feature -** `LambDynamicLights`
- **Connected Textures Feature -** `Continuity`
### Sodium - In Game Optimized Settings
- **If you are going to use Zoomify**:
  - Click `Options`, go to `Controls` - `Key Binds` and scroll down until you see a red key bind.
  - `Save Hotbar Activator` has C button as a key bind, change it to something else and click `Done`
- Go to `Options` and `Resource Packs`. Now move `Default Connected Textures` and `Glass Pane Culling Fix` from the left section to the right section and click `Done`.
- Go back to `Options` and `Video Settings`. These are the optimized settings for performance:
  - **General**
    - `Render Distance`: 6 chunks
    - `Max Shadow Distance`: Disabled
    - `Simulation Distance`: 5 chunks
    - `VSync`: OFF
    - `Max Framerate`: Same number as your monitor's refresh rate (for 60 hz screens, change the value to 70)
  - **Quality**
    - `Graphics`: Fast
    - `Clouds`: OFF
    - `Weather`: Fast
    - `Leaves`: Fast
    - `Particles`: Decreased

    - `Entity Shadows`: OFF
    - `Distortion Effects`: 60%
    - `FOV Effects`: 60%
    - `Mipmap Levels`: 1x
## Optifine Method - Recommended For Version 1.16.2 And Earlier
- For Optifine, you should install **Forge** mod loader instead of **Fabric**.
- First of all, install [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads) for the Minecraft version you would like to play.
- Next, right click your Minecraft instance and click `Edit`.
- In the opened page, click `Mods` from the left side bar and drag **Optifine file** into the page.
