# Metin2
Metin2 is an old MMORPG game. Even though it doesn't have players as much as it used to have in the past, I still play it and found ways to optimize it. I don't think any Linux user is playing Metin2 but I still wanted to document it in case there are people thinking of playing it on Linux.
## Get Started
- First of all, make sure your system is ready for gaming following [my guide](https://github.com/citloveslinux/Linux-Gaming-Guide/blob/main/1-Prepare-Your-System.md).
- Now, we're going to be using **Lutris** to install and play Metin2. There is a Lutris script for **Gameforge Client** which means it is easier to install Metin2, we're going to be using that script.
- However, I suggest you to install Gameforge Client twice using different names for your shop and main accounts because Gameforge Client runs very buggy on Linux and the client simply doesn't launch Metin2 anymore after launching the game several times on the same client which forces you to close the whole client and reopen it. That can be annoying, so to avoid problems, I suggest you to install the client twice.
- **Step 1**: Open Lutris (surprisingly)
- **Step 2**
