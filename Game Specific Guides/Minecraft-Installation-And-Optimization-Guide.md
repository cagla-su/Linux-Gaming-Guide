# Minecraft
So, Minecraft is actually a **Linux-native** game that works with OpenGL. We won't get tired while configuring Minecraft. This is going to be fun!
## Get Started
First of all, I definitely suggest you to use [Prism Launcher](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher) because it is **open-source** and provides more options than original launcher.
### Install Prism Launcher
You can install Prism Launcher following [these steps according to your distribution](https://prismlauncher.org/download/linux/), the recommended way is installing it from Flatpak and it will configure everything itself including Java builds.
### Install Java
You should **skip** this step if you chose to install the launcher from **Flatpak**.
- You can install Java following [these steps according to your distribution](https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/getting-started/installing-java/#installing-java-on-linux)
- If you don't see your distribution here, you should install the game from Flatpak.
### Install Minecraft
- When you first launched the launcher, it'll ask you what language would you like to use. After that question, you're going to see a page about Java.
- Make sure to change **Maximum memory allocation**. Some people claim you should allocate half of your RAM but this is not good for **some cases**. If you have at least 32 GB RAM and don't perform RAM intensive tasks, you can allocate half of your RAM. However:
  - If you have 4/6/8/12/16 GB RAM, I suggest you to allocate 1024 MiB if you're not going to install heavy mods.
  - First, try 1 GB allocated RAM, if you face instability, you can try alocating 2048 or 3072 MiB RAM to configure stability.
- After completing quick setup, add your Microsoft account to connect to your account in the launcher.
- Now we can finally install Minecraft. Let's click on **Add Instance** button on top left and continue:
  - On **Version** section, click on the desired version and scroll down a bit. You should see a big "**No mod loader is selected.**" warning. There are options next to the warning. We're going to choose **Fabric** and hit **OK**.
  - Now,let's install some performance mods! I will be installing mods for **1.20.1** version, that means if you are going to use a newer version of the game, some of those mods **may not** be available for the version you play.
