# The Sims 2
- The Sims 2 is the game of most of our childhood and it is surprisingly running on Linux better than The Sims 3 (The Sims 3 can't even run properly on Windows either, it's a weird game).
- On my previous low end laptop and the laptop I'm currently using, I didn't experience any performance differences and I can say that the game runs with **native performance** on Linux.
- The Sims 2 is now an **abandonware** which means installing The Sims 2 **for free is not pirating** at all.
- The recommended way is [following this guide](https://github.com/voicemxil/TS2-Starter-Pack/wiki/Linux-Specifc-Setup-Steps), they also made a Lutris script for this web installer.
  - You can reach the Lutris script for searching `The Sims 2 - osab's TS2 Starter Pack` inside Lutris which is the easiest way. After the game is installed, it should launch **Graphics Rules Maker**, you should follow [these steps for it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UT0HX3cO4xLft2KozGypU_N7ZcGQVr-54QD9asFsx5U/edit#heading=h.6jnaz4t6d3vx).
- However, if you have a setup file or a DVD, I'm going to show you the manual steps.
- Let's begin!
## Get Started
- First of all, extract files inside the DVD into a folder and open Lutris.
- Click on `Plus (+)` on top left and go to `Install a Windows game from an executable`.
- Now simply type **The Sims 2** on `Game name` section and continue until `Select the setup file` section.
- Now click on `...` button and click on your setup file (probably setup.exe) and let the installation begin, complete the installation like how you would do on Windows.
- After installation is completed, we can install [Graphics Rules Maker](https://github.com/voicemxil/TS2-Starter-Pack/blob/main/components/GraphicsRulesMaker-2.3.0-win64.exe).
- After installing GRM, follow the next steps:
  - Open Lutris and click on `Plus (+)`, then go to `Install a Windows game from an executable`.
  - Give it any name you want and continue until `Select installation directory` section. Click on `...` button and choose `/home/yourname/Games/the-sims-2/` and continue.
  - Now click on `...` button and click on your setup file and let the installation begin, complete the installation like how you would do on Windows.
  - After GRM is installed, we can launch it but if you have 2 GPUs, make sure Lutris is running GRM via your **dedicated GPU**, you can check my [Linux Gaming Guide](https://github.com/citloveslinux/Linux-Gaming-Guide/blob/main/1-Prepare-Your-System.md#4--lutrisheroic-games) to run Lutris games on your dedicated GPU.
  - After launching GRM, you can follow [these steps to optimize your game](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UT0HX3cO4xLft2KozGypU_N7ZcGQVr-54QD9asFsx5U/edit#heading=h.6jnaz4t6d3vx).
    - If GRM cannot detect the folder of the installed game, try `Mansion and Garden Stuff` folder.
- Now you're ready to go!
## Conclusion
This guide was actually a bit short because [Sims 2 Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sims2/) did a great job while preparing the guide for 3 major operating systems. You can join their subreddit if you're interested. Dag dag Simmers. Have a nice day!
