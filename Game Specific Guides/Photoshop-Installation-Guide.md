# Photoshop on Linux
- I know Photoshop is not a game but it is the only Windows application I use on Linux and I didn't want to make a separate guide for one software, so I included Photoshop in game specific guides.
- You can apply the steps if you have a Photoshop setup file and a licence or if you want to use it pirated, both will work.
- If you want to use a **CC** version, There is an [Adobe Photoshop CC v19 Installer](https://github.com/Gictorbit/photoshopCClinux) script that allows you to install the CC version on Linux. However, when I tried the script, I saw that their host that installs Photoshop setup file is not working. That might be an issue from my side, so it can be good for you to try the script yourself.
- **CS** versions, especially CS5, **work perfectly fine**. In this guide, I'll be showing you how to install **Photoshop CS5** on Linux.
- So, let's get started!
## Download Photoshop
- You can skip this step if you already have a CS5/6 setup file and a licence.
