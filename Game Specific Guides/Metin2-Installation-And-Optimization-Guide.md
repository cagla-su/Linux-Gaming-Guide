# Metin2
Metin2 is an old legendary MMORPG game.
## Get Started
- First of all, make sure your system is prepared for gaming following [my guide](https://github.com/cutiepenguins/Linux-Gaming-Guide).
- Now, we are going to be using **Lutris** to install and play Metin2. There is a Lutris script for **Gameforge Client** which means it is easier to install than it is expected.
- However, if you are playing Metin2 mainly with **multiple sections**, you might want to install the client **twice** or even **thrice** according to how many sections you are running simultaneously.
    - It is because Gameforge Client runs buggy on Linux. When you launch the game more than twice on the same client, it doesn't let you launch any more clients due to the bug.
## Install Gameforge Client
- **Step 1**: Open `Lutris` (surprisingly)
- **Step 2**: Click the `Plus (+)` button on the top left.
- **Step 3**: Click `Search the Lutris website for installer` and type gameforge.
- **Step 4**: Now, install the `Gameforge Client` script.
- **Step 5**: Apply the same steps for the **second (or/and third)** client I suggested you install. Simply install it again but make sure you changed the folder name in the `Select installation directory` step.
- **Step 6 - For Turkish Players Only**: For Turkish keyboard layout, you should add an environment variable after installing the client. Otherwise, you will be able to see the special characters like `ƒü,≈ü,ƒ∞,ƒ±` texted by other players on your screen but when you try to use those letters, you will see `g,s,I,i` as the output.
    - What you should do is **right clicking** Gameforge Client in your Lutris library and go to `Configure`.
        - Now go to `System options` and scroll down a bit until you see the `Environment variables` section.
        - In `Environment variables` section, click `Add` and add the environment variable below:
        - `Key:` **LC_ALL** | `Value:` **tr_TR.UTF-8**
        - After clicking `Save` from the top right of the window, you're ready to go!
## Installing Metin2
- Installing Metin2 is not hard. Simply log in and install Metin2.
- However, the installer will be stuck at `95%, 97%` etc. and in this case, all you have to do is stop Gameforge Client from Lutris. When you launch the client again, you are going to see that the game is installed successfully.
- Also, once you launch the game and shut it down, you will see that your game account is stuck at `in-game` sign due to the bug. You can ignore it.
## Optimize Metin2
- **Step 1:** You might prefer using **wine-ge** build that is preinstalled with the client. However, if you want to get better performance specifically on Metin2, I suggest you install the **latest stable custom WINE build** [from the link](https://github.com/Kron4ek/Wine-Builds/releases) and extract the folder to `~/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/`.
    - If you are using Lutris from Flatpak, the location is `~/.var/app/net.lutris.Lutris/runners/wine`.
- **Step 2:** Open your file manager and follow the directory:
`~/Games/gameforge-client/drive_c/your-games-location/metin2/en-GB(or another code for your server)/bgm`
    - After reaching `bgm` folder, delete everything in the folder permanently without deleting the folder. This will help with performance as the music files that run in the background while playing are **CPU-intensive** and might reduce performance.
    - Now go back to `en-GB` folder and delete `logo1.avi` and `logo2.avi`.
    - Open `config.exe` once and click `OK`, this will create `metin2.cfg`. Now open `metin2.cfg` via a text editor.
    - `Width` **:** `1280`
    - `Height` **:** `720`
    - `BPP` **:** `16`
    - `PRE_LOADING_DELAY_TIME` **:** `0`
      - *save the file*
    - Don't forget to apply the same steps for the other client(s).
### Optimize In-Game Settings
You are ready to play after changing some in-game settings for high performance.
- **System Options**
  - **System Tab**
    - `View Distance` **:** `1`
    - `Fog` **:** `Off`
    - `Snowfall` **:** `Off`
    - `Snow` **:** `Off`
    - `Target Shadow` **:** `1` - **or** `2` **if you would like**
    - `Private Shops` **:** `5` - **or** `3` **if you would like**
    - `Item Drops` **:** `2 - Yang enabled`
  - **Game Tab**
    - `Name` **:** `Subjective`
    - `Monster info` **:** `Level (uncheck)`
    - `Animations` **:** `Performance`
    - `Show` **:** **Uncheck** these options:
      - `Chat Line`
      - `Shop name`
      - `Monster Names` - **keep it enabled if you would like**
      - `HP Bar`
