# The Sims 2
- The Sims 2 is abandonware, that's why it is not legally obtainable. So, you should either have the setup file or the DVD to install the game.
- If you are ready, let's begin!
## Get Started
- First of all, extract the files from your DVD into a folder and open Lutris.
- `(+)` **-** `Install a Windows game from an executable` **-** `Game name: The Sims 2` **-** `Continue until the "Select the setup file" step` **-** `Select the setup file` **-** `Complete the installation`
- After installation is complete, make sure the game is located correctly. To do so:
  - `Right click The Sims 2` **-** `Configure` **-** `Game Options` **-** `Executable`
    - The location is generally `~/Games/the-sims-2/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection/The Sims 2 Mansion and Garden Stuff/TSBin/Sims2EP9.exe` 
## Graphics Rules Maker Setup
- To prevent or fix compatibility issues, you should download [Graphics Rules Maker](https://www.simsnetwork.com/tools/graphics-rules-maker).
- After downloading GRM, open Lutris and follow the steps below:
  - `(+)` **-** `Install a Windows game from an executable` **-** `Game name: *anything you wish*` **-** `Change the installation directory as "~/Games/the-sims-2/")` **-** `Select the setup file` **-** `Complete the installation`
  - Make sure the app is located correctly. To do so:
    - `Right click GRM` **-** `Configure` **-** `Game Options` **-** `Executable`
    - The location is `~/Games/the-sims-2/drive_c/Program Files/Graphics Rules Maker/bin/GraphicsRulesMakerUi.exe`
  - After GRM is installed, you can launch it. However if you have two GPUs, make sure Lutris is running GRM via your **dedicated GPU**, you can check my [Linux Gaming Guide](https://github.com/cagla-su/Linux-Gaming-Guide?tab=readme-ov-file#hybrid-graphics) to see how to play games through your dedicated GPU.
  - After GRM is launched, select `The Sims 2` from the `Game` tab. It should detect your Sims folder automatically but if it cannot, try `Mansion and Garden Stuff` folder.
  - Now click `Auto-detect`. If you have an iGPU, change the `Force texture memory` value to **512** or **1024** to your liking.
  - As the last step, click `Save Files...`. Do not forget to perform the same steps for `The Sims 2 Body Shop`.
- Now you are ready to play The Sims 2!
